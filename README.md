# ToolShare
final group project, Rochester Institute of Tech 

Brief problem statement 
We represent a funding group (Investiny Corp.) chartered to create applications for the benefit of communities all around the country. The product we envision is called Tool Share. At its core, Tool Share is meant to enable neighbors in a community to be able to share items of common use. The successful implementation should make it easy to anyone wanting to participate to register and be able to share or borrow items.
The Tool Share product is intended to improve communities by providing and easy mechanism for sharing items between neighbors. We envision this to primarily consist of tool exchanges but the implementation must be easily extended to include items of different kinds. 

We want a product whose emphasis is on ease of use, whose navigation is straightforward and where the status of items and users is clearly displayed.

In order to facilitate communities with a place to share common used home tools, Investiny Corp has requested for a web-based Application that can do the process of having people in different Zip codes to have access to a system for lending and borrowing common used home tools. 
Stakeholders 
Replace this text and the instructions below with your list in black. 
Investiny Corp. Board of Directors – oversee the projects funding and expenses. Have vested interest in the proven success of the product but are not involved in the planning and execution. 
Investiny Corp. Product Owner – will act as principle representative for Tool Share product needs. He/she champions the product with the Board of Directors, helps facilitate product decisions and has the ultimate say on when and what features should be released.
Software Engineering Team – is responsible for the day-to-day operations and coordination of all aspects related to the software product's life-cycle. This include, among others: planning and delegation of team roles and responsibilities; elicitation and clarification of requirements; analysis and design; implementation, testing and release of all software components.
Beta Testing Team – represent the target user base for Tools Share. Will be available in later phases of the project to conduct acceptance testing and provide feedback on product release.

End Users of the application – The target users who eventually will be using the system. In other words, people living in different share zones using the ToolShare Application.

Users profile
The target user must:
- have basic experience using computers and browsing the internet. Has filled out online forms or surveys and may have purchased or sold a product.
- have a computer with access to the internet
- have an interest in improving their community by lending or borrowing items of common use with others living near by
- is willing to share information such as home address and contact information

System requirements
At a high-level this project will be source controlled in SVN, run on Django using python, sqlite and needs to be compatible with the latest browsers. 

Although the application needs to be accessible through the internet, deployments and demonstrations for this phase of the project will take place within the RIT Software Engineering environment. To this end, you must understand and document the target platforms from the perspective of the client browser as well as that of the server. Make sure to capture versions or software dependencies, programming languages and hardware specifications that are available for your use and proceed only after you document and confirm these with the customer.
